      <br> Formed in 1993 by Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter. The duo
      achieved significant popularity in the late 1990s as part of the French house
      movement and had continuous success in the years following, combining elements
      of housemusic with funk, techno, disco, rock and synthpop influences. They
      are also known for their visual stylization and disguises associated with their
      music; the duo have worn ornate helmets and gloves to assume robot personas
      in most of their public appearances since 2001 and rarely grant interviews
      or appear on television.
